Software Recomendation Portfolio Project

Readme file, why isn't this file being tracked

For the Data Science Carrer Course on Codecademy, I was tasked with making a very simple recommendation project. I do pottery as a hobby and I occasionally take custom orders, so I decided to build a simple program to help people make custom orders.

The initial step would be asking the user if they want to use an existing piece I’ve made as a reference by asking different questions and that satisfies the requirements of the project.
